          election meeting. They shall take office on January / 25 and serve for

          held at the last meeting in the fall with the new officers taking
          office in January. This provides for a period of transition from the
          outgoing Council to the incoming Council as well as providing

          officer position within an ACM chapter shall be in general limited to
          two full consecutive terms in the same position. This recommendation
          is intended to encourage the continuing infusion of new volunteers
          into the organization and to encourage office holders to give thought
          to planning for their successor. Appointment or nomination to a third
          or subsequent consecutive term should be limited to situations where
          such appointment or nomination is believed to be in the best interests
